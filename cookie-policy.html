            <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
            <p>A cookie is a small file that, if you consent to it, is sent to your browser from a web server and is stored on your computer. Every subsequent time you load a page, image or other resource from the same web server, your browser sends the cookies back, allowing the webserver to recognise who it has seen before, and then remember information about you. A first-party cookie is a cookie sent by the web server that hosts the page you are visiting. For example, if you load a page on the {{ site.company.name }} website and the Codenests.com web server sends a cookie along with the page, that cookie is a first-party cookie. A third-party cookie is a cookie sent by a web server other than the one that hosts the page you are visiting. For example, if you visit a page on the {{ site.company.name }} website, and that page loads an image from an advertising network, and in the process the advertising network sets a cookie, that cookie would be a third-party cookie. Browsing the {{ site.company.name }} website sets both first-party and third-party cookies. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than information about how you use the Website and the data you choose to share with us (including data you automatically share with us by way of your browser settings). In particular, we use the following cookies:</p>
            <h2>Our cookies</h2>
            <h3>Cookie consent status</h3>
            <p>We use this to save your consent to allow cookies.</p>
            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
            <p>This service gives us anonymous information about your journey around our site, giving us the ability to improve it. While this uses third-party cookies, the information is not combined with other sites which use the same system.</p>
